# Hardware Team

The Node.js Hardware Team loves hardware, and we hope you love hardware too! The whole ethos behind NodeBots is to make working with hardware accessible for everyone.

## Mission

The purpose of this team is to identify and remove barriers to entry for working with NodeBots. We are focused on barriers to entry that are related to Node.js and surrounding technologies, such as NPM.

This team is focused on the difficulties that users encounter when consuming common hardware libraries and the difficulties that developers face when creating and distributing these libraries.

## Contributing
